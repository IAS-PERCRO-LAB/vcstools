vcstools
========

The vcstools module provides a Python API for interacting with different version control systems (VCS/SCMs)
It is used in tools like `wstool <https://wiki.ros.org/wstool>`_ and `rosinstall <https://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosinstall/html/>`_, which are frequently used in ROS.

This should not be confused with ``vcstool`` (no trailing ``s``), which provides the ``vcs`` command line tool and is otherwise unrelated to this repository, see: https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool

See http://www.ros.org/doc/independent/api/vcstools/html/
